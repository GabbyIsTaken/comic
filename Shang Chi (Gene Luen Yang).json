  "description": "An ancient and evil secret society has remained in hiding since the death of their leader, Zheng Zu. But now a successor has been chosen to shift the balance of power in the world: Zheng Zu’s son, Shang-Chi! In a fractious family reunion, Shang-Chi gets to know the siblings he never knew he had, including the deadly Sister Hammer! But who among them can he trust — and who is trying to kill him? Shang-Chi will find out the hard way as his life ends up on the line — and the only one who can save him is…his father? But isn’t he dead?!\n\nNOTE:\nUsually the single issues's chapter #s after I run out of volumes are just 'Issue 9 is Chapter 9, even if the last chapter was Volume 2' but there's like 3 series in here for no reason (Shang-Chi 2020, Shang-Chi 2021, and Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings 2022) so I just kept it going from the volume [might make it like usual when vol. 4 comes out]\nreading this back and it sounds incomprehensible; just don't worry about it keep pressing next chapter and you're good",
