  "description": "Jonathan Kent tells the story of how his boy, Clark, grew from the young boy down on the farm into the young man desiring to see the world.   Ma & Pa Kent fear the power growing within young Clark while Clark, himself, questions his role in life and among humanity.   We see the origins of a man who feels the weight of responsibility that comes with such great power.",
