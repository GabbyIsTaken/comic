  "description": "All of it. Kinda.\nVery arbitrary selection of Spider-Man comics with the through-line being the main series: ASM. If something that I didn't include is referenced, usually there will be an editor's note with the issue/arc the reference is from so just look up a synopsis of that or something idk\nIf I ever get around to reading all this I'll add all the important stuff I missed and remove all the not-important stuff (AKA: all the bad stuff that isn't referenced again)\nIf it's something you've heard of and it's in the main 616 universe, then it's probably here. Everything else you've heard of is probably in Ultimate Spider-Man.\n\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO READ ALL OF THIS. Here's some good jumping on points:\nUltimate Spider-Man: It's not in this collection but it's a more modern, complete story going from the bite to his death (and eventually Miles Morales).\nStan Lee's run: Made in the '60s but the start is always a good point to start (v1 to \nJMS's run: Universally liked despite including some of the most universally hated books in Spider-Man history, so that says a lot.

(v\nNick Spencer's run: The run right before the current run (and the only one I've fully read), IMO it really sucks but it definitely is a jumping on point! (v\nZeb Well's run: The current run, I've heard bad things but I haven't read it so idk. (v",
