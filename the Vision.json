  "description": "Vision wants to be human, and what’s more human than family? So he heads back to the beginning — to the laboratory where Ultron created him as a weapon. The place where he first rebelled against his destiny and imagined that he could be more — that he could be a man.\nThere, he builds them. A wife, Virginia. Teenage twins, Viv and Vin. They look like him. They have his powers. They share his grandest ambition — or obsession? — the unrelenting need to be ordinary. Behold the Visions! Theirs is a story of togetherness and tragedy — one that will set the Android Avenger on course for a devastating confrontation with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.",
