  "description": "She is one of the greatest heroes the world has ever known—an icon of equality, a symbol of power, a tireless champion of peace and justice. But who is Wonder Woman really? She’s about to find out.\nThemyscira, the island paradise she left behind to defend Earth from the war god Ares, has vanished, and the magical power of her Lasso of Truth has disappeared along with it. In a sprawling saga that bridges her first year as a hero with the present day, the Amazon Princess must team up with her greatest enemy—the brutal beast-woman Cheetah—to find her vanished homeland and seek the truth about her origins.\nCan this unlikely alliance save her sisters and the world? Or will Wonder Woman’s quest for answers lead to even deeper, darker and deadlier places?",
