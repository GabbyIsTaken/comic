  "description": "This isn't really a *series*, per se, but they do have the same subtitle and team on it so might as well lump em together. I love Gurihiru\n\nSpider-Man and Venom:\nPrepare to see Spider-Man and Venom like you never have before-as begrudging buddies? It’s fun of the freaky variety when a sinister swap leaves Spidey and Venom’s minds in each other’s bodies! But who could be behind this craziness – and why?! And can things get any more jumbled for your favorite arch-frenemies? You bet they can! Spider-Man and Venom must somehow force themselves to work together to fix their situation, but will they learn the value of friendship?\n\nThor and Loki:\nThey’re brothers, gods and sons of Odin — but Thor and Loki just don’t get along! Especially since Loki keeps tricking Thor into doing things that will get him in trouble. Even so, when Loki dares Thor to steal a powerful relic from Odin’s vault, how can the God of Thunder say nay? As Loki summons a serpent set on city-smashing, Thor has to clean up his mess…again! But when the feuding siblings are transported to an alternate universe, they meet a very different Thor: Jane Foster! Can the Goddess of Thunder help these misbehaving brothers find their way home?",
