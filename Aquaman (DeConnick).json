  "description": "In the wake of the epic “Drowned Earth,” an amnesiac Arthur washes ashore on a remote island and ends up being cared for by a young woman named Caille, who’s just a little too curious for comfort. And as a lifetime of horror movies has taught us, there’s something strange going on in this island village. Aquaman needs to come to his senses quickly…or he might wind up sleeping with the fishes instead of just chatting with them.",
