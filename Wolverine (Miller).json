When Shingen humiliates Wolverine in front of Mariko, the hero loses heart, drowning his sorrows in beer, bar fights…and the arms of wild assassin Yukio. But when betrayal strikes from an unexpected source, can Wolverine reclaim his honor and rescue Mariko and himself from Shingen’s trap? Then, the X-Men travel to Japan to rejoin their wayward teammate – but Viper and the Silver Samurai want to guarantee that the mutants’ story won’t have a happy ending.",
